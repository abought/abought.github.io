<h1>Other open source contributions</h1>

<p>
    I have worked on a number of projects (volunteer and otherwise) over the years for which source code is now
    available. Many of these projects are now hosted on GitHub, but in cases where code is available elsewhere, I
    have attempted to gather a few links.

    <li>
        <a href="http://googlebar.mozdev.org/">Googlebar</a>- A Firefox browser extension for Mozilla Seamonkey and
        early versions of firefox. Filled a need for easy access to general and specific browser search functionality
        in earlier, simpler times. Not affiliated or endorsed with Google Inc.

    <li>
        <a href="http://cps-vo.org/node/5834/browser">DARPA AVM Program</a>- I contributed a variety of vehicle CAD
        geometry test benches, providing scoring and design feedback for ergonomics, troop loading/exit times, and
        other physical aspects of the system. These test benches depended on reading STL geometry and XML vehicle
        component descriptions to generate physical predictions.
